#CellularAutomataSimulation 
##AKA Astroboi

This prototype explores per-pixel interactions/physics/lightsource with multithread-cpu rendering.

# Cozy

Here we can see how the astroboi can walk in the dunes that are constantly moving, leaving small grain of sands in the air
We can also see how the helment's glass can reflect the environment


# Particle interactions

In this gif, we can see how fires create ash, that can be used to burn some wood and create smokes.
Note how we can throw sand with a shovel
